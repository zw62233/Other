
# HID Origo Unified Web Provisioning ‚Äì Sample Application

This is a sample web provisioning application that integrates with HID Origo services to demonstrate pass issuance for Apple and Google Wallets.

---

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Make sure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Java**: 8  
- **Node.js**: 23.11 or later  
- **npm**: 10.9.2 or later  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Application

Navigate to the project root and run:

```bash
./gradlew build -x test
```

This command performs the following:

- Builds the frontend UI files  
- Moves the UI files into the Java `resources` directory  
- Packages everything into a JAR:  
  `origo-webpush-provisioning-0.0.1.jar`

---

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. Move to the directory containing `origo-webpush-provisioning-0.0.1.jar`.
2. Place your `application.yml` configuration file in the same directory.
3. Edit the `application.yml` with your environment-specific values.
4. Start the application using:

```bash
java -jar origo-webpush-provisioning-0.0.1.jar --spring.config.location=application.yml
```

Once running, the app will be accessible at:  
**[http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)**

---

## üß™ Testing Web Provisioning Flow

1. Start the sample application.
2. Open your browser and visit:  
   **[http://localhost:9090/wpp/token](http://localhost:9090/wpp/token)**
3. Use the **HID Origo Credential Management API** to create a new `Pass`.
4. Enter the generated `issuanceToken` on the webpage and click **Proceed**.
5. Based on the pass template, you will see one or two platform options:
   - **Google Wallet**:  
     - You‚Äôll be redirected to a Google login.
     - After authentication, a QR code will be displayed.
     - Scan it with an NFC-capable Android device to add the pass.
   - **Apple Wallet**:  
     - A new window will prompt for iCloud sign-in.
     - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.

```jsonc
{
  "responseHeader": {
    "statusCode": "405",
    "statusMessage": "The Application-ID HTTP header was missing or contained an invalid value.",
